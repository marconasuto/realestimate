# realestimate
A data-driven tool   to evaluate proprieties in King County, WA with geospatial analysis (GIS).  Performance close to Zillow's estimates for off-market houses.

## The task
*"For this project, you'll be working with the King County House Sales dataset. We've modified the dataset to make it a bit more fun and challenging. The dataset can be found in the file "kc_house_data.csv", in this repo.*

*The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions relating to what the data means.*

***You'll clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible***

 
***Based on the results of your models, your presentation should discuss at least two concrete features that highly influence housing prices****."

## Business Understanding
Very briefly: we know that the evaluation of a house when selling or buying it, depends on:

- The geographical feature (location) of the house

- Its physical features (square foot, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors etc.)

- Its grading

 

However, we don't know effectively how these features affect house prices analytically. We see this regression analysis as an opportunity to come up with recommendations for different stakeholders:

- **Buyers**

- **Sellers**

- **Realestimate as a startup** 

- **Urban developers**

<br/>

**4 main stakeholders, 6 questions to address**:

 

**Seller/Prediction**

1. “The agency gave me an estimate on that house I want to sell, but I’d love a second opinion. Where can I find it?”

 

**Buyer/Inference**

2. "I want to invest buying a new house. What are the features that matter the most to maximise my investment?"


**Realestimate as a startup**

3. “I want to do an MVP of a real-estate price predictor. Is it possible to reach an accuracy close to industry standards with just an MVP?“

 

**Urban developer**

4.1. Where and if is it affordable for a lower income class member (median lower income) to buy a house in King County?

4.2. What about for a middle income class member (median middle income)?

4.3. What about for an upper income class member (median upper income)?”
